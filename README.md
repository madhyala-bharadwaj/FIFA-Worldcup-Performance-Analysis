## Note on Plotly Plots

**Important:** Interactive Plotly plots are not directly visible in Jupyter Notebooks when viewed on GitHub. To view the interactive plots, download the notebook and run it locally.

To assist with visualization, an additional `fifa_world_cup.pdf` file has been uploaded. This PDF includes some of the plots generated in the analysis. However, not all interactive features of the plots are captured in the PDF. For the full interactive experience, running the notebook locally is recommended.
